### Text Oddities
* Some odd text timing in the Ch6 hopeless Devil fight.
    * Too-long pause after "bolts of lightning", no pause at all when it tells you how much damage you've taken
        * Check out the JP version
            * Looks like the JP version tries not to display the damage numbers at all! 
        * Insert [PAUSE] control codes as needed.

### Other weird things
* Evolution during a game over story. Phaestus -> Goblin story -> Asamin.
    * Evolved by increasing Endurance.
    * Had infinite EVO genes on.
* Why is it so hard to land accuracy-based attacks (Air Power, skills) in the Ch5 Devil fight for me, but not kuoushi?


### tech debt
* Unify spare_block and other_spare_block.

### Bugs Present in the JP Version
* Ch5 Graphical glitch in the lava when entering the second-to-last screen in the Stonehenge dungeon.
