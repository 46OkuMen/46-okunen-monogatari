Notes and utilities for the English Translation patch for *E.V.O.: The Theory of Evolution*, otherwise known as *46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinkaron*, the 1990 Japan-only predecessor to *E.V.O: Search for Eden* for the SNES. The patch has been under active development since October 2015.


### Progress
Here's how much of the script currently fits in the game:

| Segment      | %    | Strings      |
| -------------|-----:|:------------:|
| Opening      |100%  |  (42 / 42)   |
| Chapter 1    |100%  | (500 / 500)  |
| Chapter 2    |100%  | (434 / 434)  |
| Chapter 3    |100%  | (338 / 338)  |
| Chapter 4    |100%  | (747 / 747)  |
| Chapter 5    | 98%  | (877 / 892)  |
| Chapter 6    | 97%  | (312 / 319)  |
| Ending       |100%  |  (70 / 70)   |
| System       |100%  |   (5 / 5)    |
| Images       | 89%  |   (8 / 9)    |
| Encyclopedia |100%  | (935 / 935)  |
| Game Overs   |100%  | (729 / 729)  |
| Total        | 99%  |(5338 / 5367) |

This doesn't count typesetting, editing, or bugfixes. There's a lot of text, so those will take a while!

For more details on the state of the project, [here is the current TODO list](docs/todo.md).

### How do I use this?
* Wait for it to be released!
* The patch will target these disk images:
	* 46 Okunen Monogatari - The Sinkaron (J) A user.FDI `md5: CA56B37F74885C40EDC9B1D2AACB5DA6`
	* 46 Okunen Monogatari - The Sinkaron (J) B 1.FDI `md5: EE852EC006ACD94C9CFB04B2505A51D7`
	* 46 Okunen Monogatari - The Sinkaron (J) B 2.FDI `md5: 3C1C0FBE1CF0A4C1B4574FFC26A490AB`
	* 46 Okunen Monogatari - The Sinkaron (J) B 3.FDI `md5: A3934EED652627ABB45A756F13EC531A`
	* 46 Okunen Monogatari - The Sinkaron (J) B 4.FDI `md5: 60E4D019F0CEF79C3D2EA3D44E6BF70E`
* Support is later planned for this hardware-compatible disk image:
	* 46okunenm.hdi `md5: 2B00A01944048980647FCE7ADEF07F57`
* If you want to use any of the utilities for yourself, I didn't really plan for that. Check back later when there are fewer hard-coded file paths. (You'll still need your own ROMs of course.)
