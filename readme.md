Git repo for the utilities and notes for a translation hack of 46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinka Ron for the PC-98. E.V.O: Search for Eden for the SNES was a spiritual sequel/remake of this game, translating its turn-based combat into a side-scrolling platformer while enhancing the amount of time spent grinding and removing the present-day and future scenarios.
